Humans use multiple languages for communicating purposes. There are approximately 6500 languages in the world.
Learning one language takes hundreds and thousands of hours of practice, so it is nearly impossible for an average
person to learn all these languages. Here come our machines to the rescue. Machine translations are the modern
advancement in technology for Natural language processing. Machine translations mean a machine viz. a computer,
tablet, or smartphone that uses software in order to translate written or verbal texts from one language to another.
Machine translations are faster as compared to human translation. It would just take a few seconds to transfer an
entire document from one language to another. This will result in saving time. Such translators can help us to translate
one language into multiple languages, saving money and all other resources.
